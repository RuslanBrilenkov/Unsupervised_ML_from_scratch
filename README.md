# Unsupervised_ML_from_scratch
This repository is dedicated for those who would like to get a hands-on experiense in Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms. The idea is to write the algorithms from scratch based on the intrinsic understanding of the algorithm, i.e., with the minimum necessary extra packages. I will describe the algorithm and upload my Python codes. The comments are welcome. I got some ideas from the book "Machine Learning for Human Beings" by Mohit Deshpande.


1) First of all, we will generate the sample dataset. Run the code as 
python Generating_Blobs.py

The code will create the Data/ folder if it is not present. And save the generated dataset into this folder.

2) Run the visualising code as
python 2.Visualising_Data.py

The code will visualise the data set and save the plots into Plots/ folder (again, if it is not present the code takes care of creating it).

3) Run K-means, unsupervised machine learning algorithm for separating our unlabeled dataset. 
python 3.K_means.py
